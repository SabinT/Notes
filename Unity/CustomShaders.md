# Customizg HDRP Example

Amazing article (in Japanese) about how to customize HDRP's default shader's components (various passes) to support raymarching, while getting all the benefits of HDRP's built in lighting:

Nice article about writing custom raymarchers while supporting depth/shadows/perspective/orthographic:

> :warning: If you are overriding the passes in HDRP shaders (e.g., DepthOnly, GBuffer), and want to output per-pixel depth, make sure you have "pixel displacement" enabled in the shader (so that you can use the SV_Depth semantics). Otherwise you will most likely get a flat depth output on raymarched materials (unless they are extremely tesselated). Â ![image](Images/displacement.jpg)
