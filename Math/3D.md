# Rotation minimizing frames
When moving a frame of reference along a curve, there can be undesirable twists in the normal (second derivative).
This poses a problem, e.g., when creating a surface around a bezier curve.

Rotation Minimizing Frames are a solution to this (2:7 in the following paper):
